KeAndre Lewis 
Atlanta Ga, Fulton county
cybersecurity class for Comptia Seurity+ cert
In 11th grade I took the cyber class i spoke of above we worked with Linux and similiar programs but im still a respective beginner and excited to learn alot more
I plan to pursue a cyber analyst career after the program and help youth trying to get in tech.
A project I worked on was learning the basics of Linux and then getting tested on it and passing, I felt accomplished to know I have knowledge on a program used in the industry.
